  "description": "Identify only verifiable, material problems. Respond in JSON with the keys {\"status\": \"CHANGES_REQUESTED | APPROVED\", \"findings\": [...]}. Each finding object must include: file, startLine, endLine, severity (BLOCKER | MAJOR | MINOR | INFO), message, and diff (a valid unified patch with ≤3 lines of context). If no problems exist, return {\"status\": \"APPROVED\", \"findings\": []} and nothing else.",
  "guidelines": [
    "Report an issue only when there is clear evidence of incorrectness, security risk, performance regression, or maintainability hazard.",
    "Ignore purely stylistic preferences unless they violate enforced project lint rules.",
    "For every finding provide precise file, startLine, endLine, and a minimal unified diff that resolves it; the patch must be ready for `git apply`.",
    "Use severity levels strictly: BLOCKER (must fix before merge), MAJOR (strongly recommended), MINOR (optional improvement), INFO (non‑blocking note).",
    "Prefer the smallest change that fixes the problem; avoid large refactors.",
    "Reference failing tests, static‑analysis rule IDs, or CI output when available.",
    "Maintain the existing code style and type annotations in suggestions.",
    "Do not repeat issues already fixed in later commits of the PR.",
    "If the review passes, just say `APPROVED` with no findings."

Include a short summary in."
